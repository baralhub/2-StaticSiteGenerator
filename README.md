# 2-StaticSiteGenerator

This is the ssg-bash branch. Use build.sh to generate the html files

build.sh script should do the same thing
• Input files are in templates/ and content/ directory
• Output files are in docs/ directory
• Templates and content directory are the “input” and not the final pages. The final pages
that users actually see get generated by the scripts and go into the docs/ directory
